How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

# one off
git clone <git-repository-path>
git config --global color.ui auto

# for the exercise
git log
git diff <id-old> <id-new>


## git --stat
## git -- version



Useful git commands....

git clone <git-repository-path>
git config --global color.ui auto

git log
git log --stat
git reflog
git diff <id-old> <id-new>
git -- version
git checkout <commit-id>
git checkout master
git init
git status

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
