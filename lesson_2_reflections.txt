What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	To create the .git directory and enable user to perform commit later on. Initially the commit count is zero.


Instructor Notes:
	If you accidentally add a file to the staging area, you can remove it using git reset. For example, if you accidentally add lesson_2_reflections.txt, but donâ€™t want it to be committed yet, run git reset lesson_2_reflections.txt and the file will be removed from the staging area, but it will still be in your working directory.


Useful command

	git init
	git add <file>
	git status
	git reset <file>

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	You add files that are in the working directory into the staging area - these are the files to be tracked by Git.
	You then do a mass commit to take a snapshot of the entire staging area and add to the Git repository.
