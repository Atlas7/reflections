When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	- If I wish to build something based on someone else's Github codebase, I am able to "fork" the original repository to my Github account. Then develop from there.
	  (Rather than downloading someone else's Github repository, onto my local PC desktop, followed by uploading to my Github account.)
	- Having a remote repository enable ease of remote collaboration with other programmers.
	- It also enables ease of project sharing to the public.
	- It also acts as a form of "backup". e.g. if the home PC desktop blows up, it's good to know there is a backup repository in the cloud (GitHub).


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	- not quite sure... (yet!)


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	- branch: node A of local repository branch out to node B and C of same local repository
	- clone: clone lcoal repository A from one local location to another local location.
	- clone: cline Github repository A from one Github location to another local location.  (and vice versa)
	- fork: clone Github repository A from one Github location to another Github location.  (and vice versa)


Extra notes...

	Previously when I submit the command..
	
		git commit

	It kept giving me the error message... error: There was a problem with the editor.... Please supply the message using either -m or -F option.
